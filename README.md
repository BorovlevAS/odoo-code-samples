# Odoo Custom Modules (Code Samples)

This repository contains several Odoo modules that demonstrate my experience in
backend development, business logic design, and integrations with external
systems.  
All modules are anonymized versions of real commercial functionality and do not
include client-specific code.

## Included Modules

- **Sale Order Return**  
  Advanced return & exchange workflow with stock moves, credit notes, and
  recursive quantity tracking.

- **Warranty Certificate**  
  Automatic generation of warranty certificates with public access links and
  optional SMS notifications.

- **Checkbox Integration Extension**  
  Unified API wrapper supporting both Checkbox Cloud API and local
  KassaManager devices.

- **POS PrivatBank Integration**  
  Payment processing through PrivatBank card terminals (purchase + refund)
  using socket protocol.

- **MIS Builder Customization**  
  Adds fiscal-year-aware calculation modes and extends MIS Builder expression
  processor using safe monkey patching.

## Notes

- All internal module names and dependencies are replaced with neutral ones.
- Modules are provided as examples of code structure, architecture, and
  integration patterns.
- Each module includes its own README with detailed documentation.
